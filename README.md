# plotly-challenge

In this activity, I levereged Plotly, json, and d3 to create an indepth analysis of belly-button biodiversity. I used d3 to read the data present in the json file to create tables to store the data that was selected via a dropdown menu on the web server. 

When the data was selected via the dropdown menu, it populated three areas of the page: a table showing the demographic data of the specific id chosen, a horizontal bar chart of the belly-button data, and a bubble chart of the data.
